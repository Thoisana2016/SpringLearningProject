DEPENDENCY 
===========
An object unsually requires objects of other classes to perform its operations. We call these objects dependencies.

INJECTION
===========
The process of providing the required dependencies to an object. 



DEPENDENCY INJECTION 
=====================
1. Dependency Injection is a design pattern on which dependency of the object is injected by the framework rather than creating by the Object itself. It is called **IoC**(Inversion of Control)
2. Dependency Injection reduces coupling between multiple objectes as its dynamically injected by the framework.
3. Spring IoC Container uses DI to inject one object into another object
4. There are mainly three types of Dependency Injection: 
  a. Constructor Injection
  b. Setter Injection
  c. Field Injection
